<h1>Blithe Man's Blues in Denver, CO</h1>

<p>Blithe Man's Blues is a three-man and one-woman blues and jazz band based in Denver, CO. We have been around since 2005. You can find information about where we perform and what kinds of blues we play.
 </p>
<h2> Blithe Man's Blues CD</h2>
<p>We have recorded our first CD! You can find us on iTunes and on CDBaby. We even have a few reviews:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>"Blithe Man's Blues gives us a taste of what the Blues were meant to be: A tribute to the dirty, downtrodden, but still proud soul of our nation. These guys tell it like it is!"
  "Blithe Man's is that rarest of all bands, it is a synergistic mixing of sax and violence!"</p></div>
<h2>Blithe Events</h2>
<p>We have a full schedule this season. We'll be travelling all through Colorado, including Durango, Steamboat Springs, Boulder, and even Walsenburg! Please join us in our celebration of the Blues. </p>
